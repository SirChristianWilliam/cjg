It's getting to that point where I need to start 
noting arising problems and 
questions I have
that will need to addressed before this website can be complete.

Confer with the client: 

1. Determine what exact colors she wants. 
    The blue is secondary,
    white-ish is the main,
    and I can use a lighter blue as the tertiary/action links, but 
    I think we both would rather use greens as the accents. 
2. I still need her to show me how she wants the articles to look, as they 
    should all have a consistent format. That way I can make a component template 
    that will make integrating new articles as painlessly as possible. 
3. Client still hasn't decided on background image. 
4. I'm adding some green in now mainly for actionable buttons/links/events that can
    easily be changed if she doesn't like it. I think it gives it some flavor. 

5. Maybe I'm using it wrong, but Bootstrap is just as bad as Material UI. 
    If I want a general large container where everything reacts responsively on the
    the inside depending on viewport dimensions, then yeah maybe I'll start with 
    one of the two. It also makes consistent styling throughout the site. However, 
    any sort of edits to those styles and I immediately just create my own class 
    for the element I want to target because it's such a pain looking it up, and 
    it doesn't always even have a solution that doesn't consist of "Property !important" . 
    I honestly feel like I could do a 100% better and quicker job just using CSS and 
    nothing else. I'll try Tailwind in a future upcoming project because I read that 
    it removes repeating CSS, which would be very helpful because at th eend of this project 
    or sometime in the middle I'm going to have to do that manually. Good to learn at least, 
    I should get a hold of someone who uses MUI or Bootstrap and ask them their opinions.
