              &nbsp; One of the best decisions you can make when listing your
              home is to choose an agent local to your area. Here’s why:{" "}
              <br></br>
              <br></br>


                - GET A BETTER SALES PRICE <br></br>Working with a skilled real estate
              agent with expertise in your area can help you sell your home more
              smoothly, more quickly, and often, for more money. Research from
              the National Association of Realtors shows that in 2021, homes
              listed without the assistance of a Realtor sold for a median price
              of $260,000, while those sold with an agent’s assistance sold for
              a significantly higher median of $318,000. <br></br>
              &nbsp; <br></br>  - LOCAL EXPERTISE <br></br>Local agents are the experts on our market.
              It&#39;s our main focus. Each day we study the listings,
              transactions and statistics happening in OUR community and we’ve
              developed a solid knowledge base as well as gut instincts about
              real estate in our area. Often, getting the best possible outcome
              on a sale starts with listing at the right price and time, and
              nobody is in a better place to help you with that than someone who
              works in our local market day in and day out. Plus, we’re familiar
              with local ordinances and resources should you need an inspector,
              a painter, an exterminator, a plumber, a mover or any of the other
              professionals that might be needed to ensure a successful sale.{" "}
              <br></br>
              &nbsp; <br></br>  - ENTHUSIASM FOR LOCAL COMMUNITY <br></br>Someone who has lived in
              their community for some time likely has a fondness for it. They
              can give firsthand brags about the schools, library, restaurants,
              parks, events etc. and be a sincere, enthusiastic salesperson for
              the area AND your property. <br></br>
              &nbsp; <br></br>  - ACCOUNTABILITY<br></br> You&#39;re more likely to get comprehensive,
              honest, over-and-above service from someone you could run into at
              church, kids events and businesses as you go about your daily
              life. Living in a community tends to hold people accountable,
              because as we all know, word gets around. Plus, it stands to
              reason that someone from your area would care more about you than
              a stranger from out of town. <br></br>
              &nbsp; <br></br>  - YOU’RE OUR WHY Last but not least, your local real estate
              agents WANT to work with you. Most of us got into this line of
              work to help our friends, family and neighbors with one of the
              most significant happenings in their lives. We don&#39;t complain
              about having to drive out to &quot;the sticks&quot; or make off
              comments about rural quirks. You are our peeps! We feel honored
              and privileged to help you.
