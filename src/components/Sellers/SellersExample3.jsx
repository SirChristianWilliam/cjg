              Many sellers get overwhelmed trying to decide which pre-listing
              improvements to make, if any. Obviously, if you have a leaking
              roof or broken windows, those things need to be taken care of
              before putting your home on the market. But there are a few
              lower-cost upgrades that are relatively easy to do and will get
              you the most bang for your buck.<br></br>
              <br></br> CURB APPEAL <br></br>Yes, first impressions matter. Many
              times it’s the listing photo of the front of your home that
              determines if buyers will take a closer look. Or maybe they do a
              drive-by to see it in person before scheduling a showing. A little
              sprucing up outside goes a long way. <br></br>
              <br></br>- Repair/replace damaged siding <br></br> - Touch up
              paint, especially trim <br></br>- Replace rusty or damaged mailbox
              <br></br> - New garage door(s) – one of the highest
              return-on-investment items <br></br> - Add window boxes, potted
              plants or a chair to create a welcome <br></br>
              <br></br>KITCHENS &amp; BATHROOMS<br></br>
              Clean, modern bathrooms and kitchens consistently top the wish
              list for homebuyers, but this doesn’t mean you need to do a
              complete remodel: <br></br>
              <br></br> - Fresh paint <br></br> - Resurface cabinets &amp;
              update hardware <br></br> - Re-caulk sinks <br></br> - Add/update
              lighting <br></br>
              <br></br>GENERAL <br></br>It can be difficult to see your home
              with an impartial eye. After living in your space for years, you
              become accustomed to it’s flaws. That’s why it’s always good to
              have an impartial person, like a real estate agent, do a walk
              through and make a list of things that stand out. Typically I hear
              buyers take note of the following items: <br></br>
              <br></br> - Stained ceilings <br></br> - Missing tiles <br></br> -
              Weathered/rotting decks <br></br> - Pet smells – top complaint{" "}
