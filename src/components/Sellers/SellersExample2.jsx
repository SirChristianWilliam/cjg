              <br></br>One of my goals as your listing agent
              is to get you the best price possible for your home. It’s well
              established that pricing correctly from the start makes all the
              difference in how quickly a home sells and also how satisfied
              sellers are with the offers they receive. Often, pricing higher
              than market value can actually result in a much lower actual sale
              price (or no sale at all!) because when buyers see too many price
              drops, they think something is wrong with the property.<br></br> <br></br>My
              approach is to do everything I can to determine exactly where your
              property should be priced based on the current market. This starts
              with taking the time to fully get to know your property. If an
              agent gives you a price point for your home without even seeing
              it, they aren’t doing their job. <br></br><br></br>I’ll help you identify any
              easy-to-fix issues that take away from home value, and work with
              you to address them before listing, whether that means rolling up
              my sleeves and helping you regrout that bathroom sink or
              connecting you with a trusted home improvement professional to
              replace those rotted deck boards or crusty kitchen faucet.
              <br></br><br></br>Likewise, if your home has popular or unique features that will
              add value, such as smart technology, energy efficient materials or
              a killer bar in the garage, I’ll be sure to include an accurate
              value for them. A good market analysis takes into account each
              property’s specific features, not just number of bathrooms and
              square footage. <br></br><br></br> Next, I take the time to do careful comparisons
              and adjustments against houses in your area that have sold
              recently, so that you have actual examples of what buyers were
              willing to pay.<br></br><br></br> Once I’ve gathered the information, we break it
              down and discuss the reasons for pricing higher, lower or right at
              market value, as well as the specific costs involved in selling a
              home so that you know where you can expect to come out.<br></br><br></br> My goal is
              to give you the best possible information so that together we can
              come to a price point that makes sense to you and gets you what
              you want.<br></br><br></br><a href="mailto:catjackson@edinarealty.com">Contact</a> me to get started on your free market analysis.
