          - Extremely helpful, friendly, a joy to work with and just an amazing
          person. She's a total ROCKSTAR - Josh S. - Cat Jackson has got to be
          the best real estate agent I have ever met...She went way beyond what
          she had to do. She researched everything and helped us sort stuff out.
          She is the most kind friendly person I've ever met with a real estate
          license. I would recommend her and her agency to anyone. - George S. -
          This was my first home purchase and Cat made sure I understood each
          part of the process and had the resources I needed to make good
          decisions. She asked the questions I didn't even know to ask. She was
          friendly and laid-back but so on top of everything and always there
          when I needed her. - Jen K
